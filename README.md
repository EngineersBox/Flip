# Flip

A simple grid based game where the player clicks on squares which flips the state (colour, black or white) of the current square and the Von Neumann neighbours:
Key:
- x = non-neighbour
- o = neighbour
- \# = current square

[x] [o] [x]\
[o] [#] [o]\
[x] [o] [x]

The aim is to flip all the squares to a white state.
